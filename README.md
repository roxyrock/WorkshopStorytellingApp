# Storytelling App

This project is a small interactive storytelling app built as part of a freeCodeCamp workshop.  
Users can choose between three genres — **Scary**, **Funny**, and **Adventure** — and the app displays a short story of the selected type.

## 🚀 Features

- Three selectable story genres  
- Dynamic story display using DOM manipulation
